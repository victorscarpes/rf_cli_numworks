# rf_cli_numworks
This repo contains 3 python files meant to be used on the Numworks graphing calculator. Together, those 3 files implement a command line interface that helps analyse 2-port active networks. The files are the following:

* `sig_fig.py`: Module that defines functions to round numerical values to significant figures and format them to different formats.
  
* `rf_active_tools.py`: Module that defines functions to analyse 2-port active networks.
  
* `rf_cli_numworks.py`: Main script that interacts with the user. The printing expects the calculator setting **[Python font size]** to be set to **[Small]**.
